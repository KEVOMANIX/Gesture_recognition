# Gesture_recognition
This repository hosts the source code and resources for a gesture recognition project implemented solely using computer vision techniques. The project aims to recognize and interpret hand gestures captured through image or video data, enabling intuitive interaction with computer systems and devices without relying on deep learning models.
Key Features:

Computer Vision Techniques: Implementation of computer vision algorithms and techniques such as contour detection, feature extraction, and template matching for analyzing and interpreting hand gestures.

Real-time Gesture Detection: Real-time gesture recognition functionality leveraging computer vision libraries such as OpenCV for capturing and processing live video streams from webcams or other camera devices.

Gesture Classification: Algorithms for classifying detected gestures into predefined categories or commands, enabling interaction with computer systems and applications through hand movements.

User Interface: Example user interfaces and applications demonstrating how gesture recognition can be integrated into interactive systems and applications, with support for both desktop and mobile platforms.

Documentation and Tutorials: Detailed documentation and tutorials covering the usage of the provided codebase, understanding the implemented algorithms, and integrating gesture recognition into new projects and applications.
